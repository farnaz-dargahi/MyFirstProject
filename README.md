# Lab: Student Grade Calculator

This simple Java program asks the user for a student’s name and three test scores, 
calculates the average score, and displays the letter grade (A–F) based on the average.


## Learning Objectives
- Practice using variables, input/output, and basic arithmetic operations.
- Apply conditional statements (`if–else`) for grade evaluation.
- Reinforce user interaction using the `Scanner` class.


## How to Run
1. Open your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse).
2. Create a new Java project named **Lab_StudentGradeCalculator**.
3. Add the file **Main.java** to your project.
4. Run the program and enter:
   - The student’s name  
   - Three test scores (e.g., 85, 90, 78)


## Example Output
Enter student name: Alex
Enter first score: 85
Enter second score: 90
Enter third score: 78

--- Student Report ---
Name: Alex
Average Score: 84.33
Letter Grade: B
